The proposed Accident Safety app aims to be a comprehensive and immediate solution to most traffic accidents. It uses in-built phone sensors to determine the occurrence of any accidents in the background, and provides an SOS alert to every nearby user. Then, it provides any first responders with an AR-based guide to treat any injuries detected via scan, with interactive voice-based directions. In brief, it utilizes various cutting-edge technologies to handle any accidents efficiently and in every possible way and reduce all casualties and damages.
